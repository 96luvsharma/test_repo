# About the Repository
## This is my very first working app to analyse F-Score of multiple and single firm. 
## It also has a portfolio returns calculator which calculates the historical returns of the selected firms and shows the average return of the porfolio.

### The fscore_opt.py file is the library I created to make repeating processes automated for multiple firms, saving me time in the long run and helping me scale the application.
